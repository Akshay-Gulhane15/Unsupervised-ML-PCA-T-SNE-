Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are both popular dimensionality reduction techniques used in data analysis and visualization.

1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Objective:
PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data while preserving the most important information.

Benefits:
Reduces computational complexity by focusing on the most significant components.
Helps identify patterns and relationships in GitHub data.


2.t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):
Objective: 
t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that aims to preserve the local structure of the data in lower-dimensional space.

Benefits:
Captures complex non-linear relationships in the data.
Useful for visualizing clusters and identifying meaningful patterns in GitHub repositories, user behavior, or code contributions.
